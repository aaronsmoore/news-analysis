News Classification and Sentiment Analysis

In this notebook, we'll be analyzing a news data set from this website (https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/)

tl;dr:

Libraries used:

    sklearn specifically PassiveAggressiveClassifier among many more
    re
    The VADER lexicon
    and many more standard libraries

Key Takeaways:

    We trained a PassiveAgressiveClassifier and achieved an accuracy of about 94% (with precision and recall ~93%)
    Preformed sentiment analysis and saw that FAKE articles were the usually the most positive or negative articles present in the dataset

Things I Learned:

    Fake news is really scary and often seems real
    How much choice of model impacts accuracy
